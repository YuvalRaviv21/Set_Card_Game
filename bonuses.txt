BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1. no use of numbers in our imolementations;
2. in table dealer and player;
3. for timer we changed the filed in conig and tested, if turntimetables<=0 we made dealer check for sets on table every time he
    removed card,the same for the size of the tables, and amount of player,
    the sime for freeze times, when.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. in terminate() we called dealer.stopPlayers() and in player we waited for ai to terminte if exicted;
2. in dealer and in player
3. in the log file.
--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

1.we updated reshuffle time and startime as field that will help as determine what time to display.
config.turnTimeoutMillis > 0 we used reshuffle tume,
if config.turnTimeoutMillis > 0 we used startime.
config.turnTimeoutMillis <= 0 there is a loop in placeCardsOnTable() that will check if there is a set on table,
and will remove and place cards accordingly;
2.in dealer, in updateTimerDisplay() and placeCardsOnTable();
3.we change the configuration of the file, make a deck with specific cards;

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

1.player thread and aiThread are in sync on key pressedQueue, and if set or queue are of size 3 they will wait for the dealer to check them,
  the player and the dealer are in sync on the table, so when cards are chagne, the player will wait.
  the dealer will wait between each time update, and will be interupted by player if his set needs to be checkced.
2.dealer in evey method that used methods on tabel and player.
  player, in player.run(), aiThread.run(), keyPressed().
3.we chacked with printing in terminal and chacked that nobody is working wile they shouldnt.
